          <br />
            <p>This second edition of Data Structures Using 
              C has been developed to provide a comprehensive
               and consistent coverage of both the abstract concepts of
                data structures as well as the implementation of these 
                concepts using C language. It begins with a thorough overview 
                of the concepts of C programming followed by introduction of
                 different data structures and methods to analyse the complexity
                  of different algorithms. It then connects these concepts and 
                  applies them to the study of various data structures such as arrays, 
                  strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, and graphs. 
                  The book utilizes a systematic approach wherein the design of each
                   of the data structures is followed by algorithms of different operations 
                   that can be performed on them, and the analysis of these algorithms in 
                   terms of their running times. Each chapter includes a variety of end-chapter
                    exercises in the form of MCQs with answers, review questions, and programming 
                    exercises to help readers test their knowledge.

                <p>
                  If you're not familiar with C, this book should be a pass for you. If you've already learned the language and want to move on to a DS book
with examples in the language you know, this book is quite good.

Pros:
- encourages rigorous practice
- has many informative examples
- material on the mentioned data structures is covered fairly thoroughly
- you may pick up some calculus and linear algebra if you didn't already know it.

Null:
- You may have to learn some of the math on your own to understand some of the teachings, since it appears this
book was written for a specific course wherein the students are supposed to be familiar with the basics of linear algebra
and limits from calculus.
- More on the technician's manual side of books than the interesting or awe-inspiring attempts at showing you the beauty in CS.

Cons:
- The book can be inaccurate in its representation of C, which doesn't really affect how well it teaches data structures
- The book sometimes forgets to teach the material, instead just explaining what you already know about a graphic depiction.
Example: on two-way threading in chapter 10: "Node 5 contains a NULL pointer in its LEFT field, so it will be replaced to point to node 2, which is its in-order predecessor. Similarly, the LEFT field of node 8 will contain NULL because it has no in-order predecessor..." (describing a perfectly self-explanatory graphic depiction - assuming you know the concepts that are being referred to. The paragraph goes on and on to minutia, where it could be spending this time covering a topic you were expected to learn by osmosis: the 'in-order predecessor', and how it's a natural system of linking because LNR traversal is such a natural way to move through a tree's data.)

Overall, I can only recommend the book to somebody who knows C well already. C Programming: A Modern Approach 2nd ed is a great way to get familiar with the language before branching out into more CS-heavy books like this. If you're thrown off by a few inaccurate statements and representations of C here and there, this may not be the book for you, but I like it.
